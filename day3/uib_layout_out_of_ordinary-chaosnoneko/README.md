# Movie Genres

**Instructions**:

1.  Create a section with the class `genres`. Make it a flex-container.
2.  Inside the flex-container, create 6 sections with the following content and background-colors. They should be created in the following order:
    - Action → dodgerblue
    - Thriller → rgb(190, 178, 178)
    - Comedy → rgb(255, 214, 30)
    - Horror → black
    - Drama → darkgrey
    - Romance → red
3.  For each section, center the font.
4. Each flex-item should have a basic width of 200px and a fixed height of 100px. By default, each flex-item should take up all extra space.
5. The "romance" section should take up three times as much space as the other sections.
6. The "comedy" section should take up six times as much space as the other sections.
    
**Hint**: Consider using flex-wrap.
